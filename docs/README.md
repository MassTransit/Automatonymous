# Automatonymous

Automatonymous is a state machine library for .NET developers. Automatonymous 
provides a fluent syntax for declaring state machines, 
including the states, events (both trigger and data events are supported), 
and state/event activities. While surprisingly easy to use for simple state 
machines, Automatonymous has many advanced features that make it usable 
in a variety of contexts.

Automatonymous is completely open source and licensed under the very 
permissive Apache 2.0 license, making it usable at no cost to anyone for 
both commercial and non-commercial use.

## MassTransit

Automatonymous is used to create sagas (process managers) in [MassTransit][1] -
a free open-source messaging framework. [Take a look][2] at how they both
play nicely together.
