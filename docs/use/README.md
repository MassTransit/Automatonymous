# Quick start

So you've got the chops and want to get started quickly using Automatonymous. Maybe
you are a bad ass and can't be bothered with reading documentation, or perhaps you
are already familiar with the Magnum StateMachine and want to see what things have
changed. Either way, here it is, your first state machine configured using 
Automatonymous.

```csharp
class Relationship
{
    public State CurrentState { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

class RelationshipStateMachine :
    AutomatonymousStateMachine<Relationship>
{
    public RelationshipStateMachine()
    {
        Event(() => Hello);
        Event(() => PissOff);
        Event(() => Introduce);

        State(() => Friend);
        State(() => Enemy);

        Initially(
            When(Hello)
                .TransitionTo(Friend),
            When(PissOff)
                .TransitionTo(Enemy),
            When(Introduce)
                .Then(ctx => ctx.Instance.Name = ctx.Data.Name)
                .TransitionTo(Friend)                   
        );
    }

    public State Friend { get; private set; }
    public State Enemy { get; private set; }

    public Event Hello { get; private set; }
    public Event PissOff { get; private set; }
    public Event<Person> Introduce { get; private set; }
}

class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

## Seriously?

Okay, so two classes are defined above, one that represents the state 
(`Relationship`) and the other that defines the behavior of the state 
machine (`RelationshipStateMachine`). For each state machine that is defined, 
it is expected that there will be at least one instance.
In Automatonymous, state is separate from behavior, allowing many instances 
to be managed using a single state machine.

    For some object-oriented purists, this may be causing the hair to raise on the back of your neck.
    Chill out, it's not the end of the world here. If you have a penchant for encapsulating 
    behavior with data (practices such as domain model, DDD, etc.), recognize that programming language
    constructs are the only thing in your way here.

## Tracking State

State is managed in Automatonymous using a class, shown above as the `Relationship`.

## Defining Behavior

Behavior is defined using a class that inherits from `AutomatonymousStateMachine`. 
The class is generic, and the state type associated with the behavior must be specified. 
This allows the state machine configuration to use the state for a better configuration 
experience.

In a state machine, states must be defined along with the events that can be raised. 
In the constructor, each state and event must be explicitly defined. As each state or 
event is defined, the specified property is initialized with the appropriate object 
type (either a State or an Event), which is why a lambda method
is used to specify the property.

### Creating instances


## Creating the state machine


### Raising events

Once a state machine and an instance have been created, it is necessary to raise an event 
on the state machine instance to invoke some behavior. There are three or four participants 
involved in raising an event: a state machine, a state machine instance, and an event. 
If the event includes data, the data for the event is also included.

The most explicit way to raise an event is shown below.

```csharp
var relationship = new Relationship();
var machine = new RelationshipStateMachine();

machine.RaiseEvent(relationship, machine.Hello);
```

If the event has data, it is passed along with the event as shown.

```csharp
var person = new Person { Name = "Joe" };
    
machine.RaiseEvent(relationship, machine.Introduce, person);
```

### Lifters

Lifters allow events to be raised without knowing explicit details about the state 
machine or the instance type, making it easier to raise events from objects that do 
not have prior type knowledge about the state machine or the instance. Using an approach 
known as *currying* (from functional programming), individual arguments of raising 
an event can be removed.

For example, using an event lift, the state machine is removed.

```csharp
var eventLift = machine.CreateEventLift(machine.Hello);

// elsewhere in the code, the lift can be used    
eventLift.Raise(relationship);
```

The instance can also be lifted, making it possible to raise an event without any instance 
type knowledge.

```csharp
var instanceLift = machine.CreateInstanceLift(relationship);
var helloEvent = machine.Hello;

// elsewhere in the code, the lift can be used
instanceLift.Raise(helloEvent);
```

Lifts are commonly used by plumbing code to avoid dynamic methods or delegates, making code
clean and fast.
